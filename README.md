_______________

I'm a technology enthusiast with a positive mindset and a wild desire to learn new things. Since beginning my journey as a Front-End Developer, I have continuously worked to improve my skills and optimize my projects more and more.

I've broad experience with ReactJS, NextJS, React Native and Typescript.

Web development has never been "just a passion" for me. It has offered an engaging challenge to continuously learn and improve my skills in creating better websites or mobile apps. What started with just a curiosity of building something has become a full-fledged passion that only makes me more interested as the years go by. :rocket:
